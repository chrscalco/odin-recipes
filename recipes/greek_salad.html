    <h1>Greek Salad</h1>

    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Make an authentic Greek salad, or Horiatiki, with this easy Greek salad recipe. Just a handful of fresh ingredients
         and a no-fuss dressing of good olive oil and a splash of vinegar is all you need!</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes: Use Roma tomatoes or vine-ripe tomatoes. They stay somewhat firm when they’re ripe, which works well
             with the crunchy bell pepper and onion. </li>
        <li>Cucumber: I prefer English cucumbers as they tend to be sweeter. If standard slicing cucumbers are all that’s 
            available, make sure to fully peel their bitter waxy skin.</li>
        <li>Onion: Red onion is sweet and mild enough serve raw. To further take the edge off, a quick soak in ice water 
            and a dash of vinegar does the trick. </li>
        <li>Olives: Briny Kalamata olives are my favorite for a traditional Greek salad, but any high-quality olive you 
            have on hand will work. </li>
        <li>Bell pepper: Choose a firm and smooth green bell pepper, which is the only bell pepper that’s used in an 
            authentic Greek salad. </li>
        <li>Feta cheese: Use quality Greek sheep’s milk feta if it’s available to you. Opt for whole blocks of feta 
            packed in brine, as it not only boasts a better flavor but allows you to serve the large chunks of feta 
            that act as the centerpiece of a traditional Greek salad. </li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil: Use a full-flavor Greek olive oil.</li>
        <li>Red wine vinegar: Adds a dash of acidity to make an easy vinaigrette with no whisking necessary. </li>
        <li>Seasoning: This salad is seasoned simply with a sprinkle of kosher salt and dried oregano.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Shock the onion (optional). Halve and thinly slice one red onion into half moons. If you’d like to mellow 
            its raw taste, fill a small bowl with ice water. Add about 1 teaspoon of red wine vinegar to the water, then 
            add the onion slices. Set aside to soak for 10 minutes or so while you prep the veggies.</li>
        <li>Prep the veggies. Slice 4 medium tomatoes into bite-sized pieces. Partially peel a cucumber into a stripe 
            pattern, then slice into half moons. Slice 1 green bell pepper into rings. </li>
        <li>Season. Place all the veggies in a large serving dish, along with a handful of pitted Kalamata olives. 
            Remove the onions from the ice water and add to the platter with the rest of the veggies. Sprinkle on 1 
            1/2 teaspoons of dried oregano and a pinch of kosher salt. </li>
        <li>Dress. Pour in 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil and 1-2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar. 
            Give everything a very gentle toss. </li>
        <li>Finish and serve. Break off or slice large pieces of feta and add to the top of the salad. 
            Finish with a final sprinkle of 1/4 tablespoon of oregano. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
