    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Line bottom and sides of a 13x9-inch baking pan with heavy duty aluminum foil, 
            leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides, lightly spray with baking spray; set aside. </li>
        <li>Beat together white sugar, brown sugar, and butter with a stand mixer fitted with paddle 
            attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. </li>
        <li>With mixer running on low, add eggs, one at a time, beating until just combined after each addition. 
            Beat in vanilla until just combined. </li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl until combined. 
            With stand mixer running on low speed, gradually beat in flour mixture until almost fully incorporated, 
            about 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. </li>
        <li>Stir in chocolate chips and toasted walnuts until combined. </li>
        <li>Transfer dough into prepared baking pan, spreading into an even layer. </li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown and set, about 40 minutes, 
            rotating baking pan front to back halfway through. </li>
        <li>Let cookie cool completely in pan on wire rack, about 1 hour. 
            Using foil overhang as handles, lift cookie out of pan. </li>
        <li>Cut into 24 (about 2-inch) squares.</li>
    </ol>
